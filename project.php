                <h1>Single-Use Batteries are killing the finances of our local fisherfolk and our shorelines</h1>
                <p>In the municipality of Bantayan alone, there are over 700 compressor-diving fishermen. Shockingly, they discard <strong>over half a million dry-cell batteries</strong> into the ocean every year. But we've engineered a solution; a powerful solar solution that promises to not only protect our planet but also ease the financial burden on the fishermen.</p>
